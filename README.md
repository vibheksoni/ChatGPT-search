# ChatGPT-search

I have modified the original ChatGPT search extension posted on Chrome extensions to only trigger the use of ChatGPT search if `@gpt` is in the search query. Otherwise, it will default to your regular search engine.

## Features

- Triggers ChatGPT search only if `@gpt` is included in the search query.
- Defaults to your regular search engine for all other searches.

## Installation

To install the extension locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vibheksoni/ChatGPT-search.git
   ```
2. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.

3. **Load Unpacked Extension**:
   - Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
   - Select the cloned repository folder `ChatGPT-search`.

4. **Use the Extension**:
   - The extension is now installed and ready to use.
   - To trigger ChatGPT search, include `@gpt` in your search query.
   - For regular searches, use your search query without `@gpt`.
